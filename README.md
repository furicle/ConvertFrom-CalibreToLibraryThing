# What's This For?

I have all my physical books recorded in [Library Thing](LibraryThing.com) to keep track of them.
I have all my ebooks in Calibre.

I'd like to also track the ebooks I own in Library Thing.
There isn't an established import/export method to do this easily.

This is a Powershell script to make that process easier.
